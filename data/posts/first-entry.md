## Welcome to my first blog site

Sup. I'm Fitzypop, and I've never written an actual blog site before. Okay, I technically didn't build it, and used a Template off 
github, but everything after that initial template is all my work.

If this was a serious blog, I would have gone with a mkdocs. Or maybe hugo, or some other template / markdown based system.

Writing a site with deno is interesting too me. There's alittle more challenge, maintaning my own site, system, content, 
and really learning TypeScript for real.

My current plan is to take this template blog site, and add new features as I encounter more question around Deno, 
Fresh, or other web development concepts.

## MVP
